### Announcements
* Thanks to Mechanical Simulation! 
* Last month was CppCon (many hours of CppCon videos goodness)
* More details about Google `abseil` library abseil.io
	* C++ Standard Library is set in stone. Everything has to be supported forever.
	* No such thing as a non-breaking change in C++
	* 5 year phase out window with automated tools to refactor code (with coding 
	  guidelines for this to work)

### OSS Lib of the Month
* Abseil
	* http://abseil.io/
	* Expected support for 20+ years
	* 0.25 Billion lines of C++ code depends on it
	* Assumes you're on C++11 and add advanced functionalities and helpers 
	  (`std::make_unique`, actual `std::chrono` typedefs, psuedo random number 
	  generators)

### Questions
* Any Local Projects or Announcements?
* New ideas for topics
